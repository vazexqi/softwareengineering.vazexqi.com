This is a sub-blog created to discuss issues with the papers, book, etc that I have read as part of UIUC's CS 527: Advanced Topic in Software Engineering. This blog will only discuss topics concerning software engineering. It might include humorous articles too.

My main blog is at <a href="http://blog.vazexqi.com">blog.vazexqi.com</a>. It also contains a fair amount of software engineering related materials but you will have to dig for it yourself. </p>

To start things off, here is a picture that most of you will find interesting:

This blog is powered by <a href="http://www.typosphere.org/trac/">Typo</a>, a <a href="http://rubyonrails.com/">Ruby on Rails</a> content management systems what is currently at version 4. Great as it is, Typo does lack proper architectural documentation and would make a great project for CS 527 :)</p>
