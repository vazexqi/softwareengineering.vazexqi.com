title: Software Engineering And Testing Research at UIUC
---
<p>
The Department of Computer Science at UIUC will be having its graduate recruitment weekend at the end of February and each research group is supposed to create a simple poster to showcase their ongoing research projects. In case anyone is interested in the projects that we do, I present to you, the Software Engineering & Testing research projects at UIUC....

The full PDF is available from <a href="https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/nchen/softeng/SEPoster.pdf">here</a>. Sometimes it displays a bit funny on Windows/Linux machine and I am not really sure why (thought it's a PDF). If the color and text do not look like the picture above, you know that something is wrong.

The poster was based on the color scheme from the WWDC Poster Templates from <a href="http://www.apple.com/science/poster/WWDC_Poster_Templates.zip">Apple</a>.
