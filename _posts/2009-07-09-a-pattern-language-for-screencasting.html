title: A Pattern Language for Screencasting

<p>
I have written a pattern language for screencasting based on my experiences producing and observing various screencasts on the internet. Through my experiences I have noticed various patterns that myself and other screencasters have used. Applying those patterns would certainly help the presentation of your screencast but, more importantly, I believe that the patterns enhance the teaching-learning experience of screencasts. And ultimately that is what matters most.

Interested readers may view the patterns <a href="/files/Patterns.pdf">here</a> (older version can be found <a href="/files/screencast_patterns.html">here</a>). The pictures that I have included are based on software for the Mac since that is what I  use for my screencasting.

At the moment, it's a rather complete version of what I had originally envisioned for such a document. It can definitely be improved but I would like to get a version out on the web for people to read in case anyone is interested in providing feedback or suggestions. This pattern language is in the shepherding stage of <a href="http://hillside.net/plop/">PLoP '09</a>.

I do maintain copyright on the document.
