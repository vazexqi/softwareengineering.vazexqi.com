<blockquote cite="http://cs527.wordpress.com/2006/10/31/human-readable-code/" title=""> "In Refactoring to Patterns (pg. 13), Josh mentions that while looking over code before a workshop, he saw code that read:



november(20, 2005)



And called a method that looked like:



public void Date november(int day, int year)"

I completely agree that code should be human readable. In fact, this was one of the reasons why I like languages like Ruby so much. Martin Fowler has written a good article on this and since I don't think I will be able to produce something of similar quality at this moment, I refer you to his post entitled <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/HumaneInterface.html">"HumaneInterface"</a>.
