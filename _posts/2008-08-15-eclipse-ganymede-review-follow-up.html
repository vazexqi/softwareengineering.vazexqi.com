title: Eclipse Ganymede Review Follow-up
---
<p>
About two months ago, I wrote my review for Eclipse 3.4 Ganymede and participated in the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/ganymede/aroundtheworld.php">Ganymede Around the World Contest</a>. As one of the first few reviewers, I am going to receive a Eclipse shirt. I have not seen the shirt yet but I have already provided my mailing address to them.
</p>

<p>
Also, I was fortuitous enough to be randomly selected as one of the 5 participants to receive an Eclipse jacket. So I'll be looking forward to that as well.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, as a follow-up, I said that I will be releasing a screencast to showcase some of the new features once the official version of Ganymede has been released. The first (I am hoping that I wlll have time to create more) has been released on the CS 427 Fall 2008 wiki page: <a href="https://agora.cs.uiuc.edu/display/cs427fa08/Eclipse+Debugger">Eclipse Debugger</a>. It shows the new <i>Enhanced Debug Hover</i> feature introduced in Eclipse 3.4. The screencast is catered toward students who have never used a debugger in an IDE before (I might be a bit presumptuous on this...)
</p>

<p>
Hopefully someone else might find the screencast useful.
