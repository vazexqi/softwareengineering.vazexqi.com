      <p> I am currently pursuing a Ph.D in software engineering at the University
      of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My goal is to create developer-oriented tools,
      libraries and frameworks that directly benefit developers and streamline the
      software engineering process. Find out more about my open source projects at my
      <a href="https://github.com/vazexqi">github</a> page. If you prefer a more
      academic treatment of my work, you may find my publications at my <a
        href="http://vazexqi.com/publications/publications.html">website.</a></p>
